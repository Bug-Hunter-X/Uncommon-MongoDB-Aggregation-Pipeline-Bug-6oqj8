# Uncommon MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon bug encountered while using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline. The bug results in unexpected data aggregation due to an incorrect stage or operator in the pipeline.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code uses the MongoDB aggregation pipeline to perform a grouping, sorting, and limiting operation on a collection named 'data'. However, the pipeline returns unexpected results, which could be due to an incorrect filter condition in the `$match` stage, or an incorrect field specified in the `$group` or `$sort` stages. This is a relatively uncommon error compared to more common issues like syntax errors or incorrect database connections.

## Solution
The solution involves reviewing each stage of the pipeline carefully to identify the source of the unexpected results.  This may involve checking the field names for typos, validating the operators used, and ensuring that the stages are arranged correctly to achieve the desired outcome. The correct solution will be shown in the `bugSolution.js` file.
